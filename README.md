The application features include things like:

--A simple authentification method by username and the position of the logged person (administrator or waiter). The app will load the information on the "angajati.txt" and will check wether the employee exists or not. If so will log in the person.

--The administrator can add or delete employees and products(from menu) or edit the data, print the menu.

--The waiter can select which table is occupied and the app would ask for his id, visualize the order or add and delete products, move the current occupied table and order to other table if the clients would like to move, visualize the bill and print it.
